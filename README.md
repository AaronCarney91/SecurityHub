# SecurityHub
A virtual security system written in java using corba.

This simulation of a home security system using Corba lets users set up a number of cameras and sensors within a home. 
If two or more security devices are triggered within a ten second time frame the security hub will contact the security provider who can 
review the alarms by reading the log and from that decide wether the police should be involved. All sensor triggers are logged in a file that users can connect to and view.
